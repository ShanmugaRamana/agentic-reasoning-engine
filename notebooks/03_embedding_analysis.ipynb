      "You are tasked with painting numbers 1 through 100 on the doors of 100 rooms. The numbers have to be painted such that there is no pattern in how the evens and odds are distributed, to avoid making one row of doors appear predominantly odd or even to those walking by. To optimize the painting process and minimize the time spent on decision making, you decide to establish a simple algorithm by which you will paint odd and even numbers on the doors. What is the algorithm that ensures an approximately even distribution of odds and evens without creating a discernible pattern?\n",
